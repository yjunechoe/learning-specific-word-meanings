<strong>Primary Investigator:</strong> Anna Papafragou, anna4@sas.upenn.edu
</p>

<p>
You are invited to take part in a research study conducted by Anna Papafragou in the Linguistics Department at the University of Pennsylvania. This consent form explains what we are studying and what you will be invited to do if you choose to consent. Please read this form and sign below to confirm that you have been informed about the study and that you want to take part. 
</p>

<p>
This research study is being conducted to understand how people learn and use language and the ways in which language might influence thought. If you agree to join the study, you will be asked to play a computer game lasting up to 1-hour during which you will view a story or scene through video or still images. We may use an eyetracker to record your eye movements on the screen and/ or an audio recording device to record verbal responses. Your participation in this study will last for the duration of the computer game, though you may be invited to return for up to 5 additional sessions. There are no known risks associated with this study other than the potential for mild boredom. 
<p>

<p>
Please note that there are other factors to consider before agreeing to participate such as additional procedures, use of your personal information, costs, and other possible risks not discussed here. If you are interested in participating, a member of the study team will review the full information with you. You are free to decline or stop participation at any time during or after the initial consenting process.

<p>
<strong>What we are studying</strong>: We are studying how people learn and use language and the ways in which language might influence thought.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Why you are being asked to participate</strong>: You are a student in a course requiring participation in research through Sona.
</p>

<p>
<strong>What you will do</strong>: You will be invited to play a 10-minute to 1-hour computer game in which you will view a story or a scene through video or still images. During and/ or after the game, you will be asked to respond (by pressing a button or speaking) to simple questions about what you have seen. You will play the game in one session, though we may invite you to play in up to 5 additional sessions.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Risks</strong>: The risks associated with this study are minimal, though you may experience slight discomfort due to boredom. There is also a minimal risk of unauthorized parties accessing responses (e.g. computer hackers), because your responses are entered and stored on an https server. This risk is minimized by Qualtricsâ€™ secure server.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Benefits</strong>: Participating in this study will not benefit you directly. You may enjoy contributing to the study of language and cognitive science.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Ending your participation</strong>: You can choose whether or not to participate in this study. If you decide to participate now but change your mind later, you may withdraw from the study at any time without any negative consequences. You can stop participating at any time by closing your browser window.

<strong>Confidentiality</strong>: In order to keep your information safe, the data that we collect is separated from your name and coded with an index number. The mapping between this index number and your name will be stored separately from the data in a password-protected encrypted database. Identifiable information is never shared with anyone outside our research team.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Data use</strong>: We may share your anonymized data with approved members of our research team, but your name number will never be associated with any data that is shared. The overall results of this study may be published in scientific journals or discussed at academic conferences, but will never include your name or any other personally identifying information.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Compensation</strong>: You will receive course credit for participating in this study. If you agree to participate in more than one session, you will receive this compensation for each session in which you participate.
